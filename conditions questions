//Now here is two questions 
//1st > take input and print number till that number , ex> input =3 than print 1,2,3 or you can say cout 1,2,3 in proper sequence
//2nd> take input and print sum of numbers till that eg> input = 5 than print 1+2+3+4+5=15 , 15 should be last output
//3rd> i will add one more prime factors finding here
#include<iostream>

using  namespace std;
int main() {
  int a ;
  cin>>a;

  int i = 1;

  while(i<=a){
    cout<<i<<endl;
    i = i+1;
    
  }
  //1+2+3+4+5=15 type question 

  
  int endnumber;
  
  cin>>endnumber;//type here 5
  

  
  i = 1;
  int sum;
  sum = 0 ;

    

  
  while(i<=endnumber){
    sum = sum + i; // 1 = 0+1 then when we do for 2nd we see 1+2=3 and this is pricipal of concept
    i = i + 1;
    
    
    

    cout<<sum<<endl;//out put is 1+2+3+4+5=15
  }
}
